This .txt file tries to tell you about the functions in javafx


===========================
What does getChildren() do?

Think of JavaFX like a tree structure (The "Scene Graph").



The Stage: The Window.

The Scene: The content inside the window.

The Root (StackPane): The main container.

The Children: The items inside the container.

getChildren() returns the list of items currently inside a layout pane.



lanePane.getChildren().add(myShape): "Put this shape inside the pane."

lanePane.getChildren().clear(): "Remove everything from this pane."

A. The Origin Problem (Translation)

SUMO: Your city might exist at coordinates x=5000, y=5000.

JavaFX: Your screen starts at x=0, y=0 (top left corner).

The Fix: We subtract mapMinX.

If the map starts at 5000, and the point is at 5005, the screen position is $5005 - 5000 = 5$. This shifts the map to the edge of your screen.

B. The Y-Axis Flip (Inversion)

SUMO: Up is Positive. A higher Y value means "North".

JavaFX: Down is Positive. A higher Y value means "South" (bottom of screen).

The Fix: mapMaxY - sumoY.

Imagine mapMaxY is 100 (the top of the map).

If a car is at y=100 (Top): $100 - 100 = 0$. (Top of screen).

If a car is at y=0 (Bottom): $100 - 0 = 100$. (Bottom of screen).


It is completely normal to find this confusing. It is one of the most common "head-scratching" moments in computer graphics because our brains are trained on high school math, but computer screens work differently.

Here is the best way to visualize it without getting lost in the numbers.

1. The "Floor" vs. The "Ceiling"

Think of the coordinate systems like measuring the height of a picture on a wall.

SUMO (The Cartesian/Math Way): Measures from the Floor up.

$(0,0)$ is on the ground.

As $Y$ gets bigger, you go higher toward the sky.

JavaFX (The Screen Way): Measures from the Ceiling down.

$(0,0)$ is the top-left corner (where the first pixel is drawn).

As $Y$ gets bigger, you go lower toward the floor.




2. The "Mirror" Problem (explain the Y part)

If you draw your SUMO map on a screen without doing the math, the map will look like a reflection in a lake.

In Real Life (SUMO): The North (Top) of the map has a high Y value (e.g., 100).

On Screen (JavaFX): If you tell the screen "Draw at Y=100", it puts the dot at the bottom of the window.

Result: Your North becomes South. Your map is upside down.


C. Zooming (Scaling)

Logic: We multiply the normalized coordinate by a factor.

Example: If scale = 5.0, then 1 meter becomes 5 pixels.

Order of Operations: You must subtract the offset (sumoX - minX) before you multiply by the scale. If you scale first, your map will fly off the screen because you are multiplying the huge 5000 coordinate by 5.
