How to Iterate (The Loop Logic)

To draw the map fully, your code loop logic should look like this structure:



Get NetBoundary: Create your window.

Get all Edge IDs: Loop through them.

Inside the Edge loop:

Get the number of lanes for this edge. (Use getLaneNumber())

Construct the Lane ID strings manually (EdgeID + "_" + index).

Draw the Lane: Get Shape and Width for that Lane ID and draw it.

Get all Junction IDs: Loop through them.

Draw the Junction: Get Shape (Polygon) and fill it with gray.
